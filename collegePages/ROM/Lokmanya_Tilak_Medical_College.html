            <h3>About</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and Hospital is one of the premier medical institutions of India. It stands today proudly serving humanity and is recognized for its yeoman’s service, nationally and internationally; as one of the best Civic-Government run hospitals, providing quality care and medical education in the city of Mumbai. It is one of the most prestigious Trauma Care Centres of Asia. It was the first dedicated Trauma Service center in our country and is always in a constant ‘state of alert’ for disasters. This hospital is an important nodal center for the medical services of the Disaster management plan in the civic context.</p>
            <p>Due to its strategic geographical location, the hospital is the first major referral center for all the trauma and disaster cases,from both major highways( western express and eastern express highways ), as well as both major railway lines ( central and western railway ). It is the only tertiary care center available to Mumbai’s suburban population, which now comprises 75 % of Mumbai’s population. Dharavi, India’s largest slum, is right next door and thevast majority of the patient population frequenting the hospital are extremely poor.</p>
            <p>Our institution has a state of the art auditorium of 505 seating capacity,which is the best amongst all medical colleges in Mumbai. It is being converted into a modern E-classroom, along with four other lecture halls. These E-classrooms will be one of the finest in country and should become a model for teaching programs in the medical field. We are proud to announce free WiFi for our Medical College’s faculty and students, via a first in the country, indigenously developed,high speed, broad band width network. These and other digital initiatives are our humble contribution to Hon’ble PM’s Digital India initiative.</p>
            <p>A clean and green surrounding helps improving the mood and well-being of everyone in the hospital; including patients, doctors and support staff. Each big tree produces the equivalent of 8 cylinders of Oxygen per day.Keeping this in mind we have initiated a major green initiative and various beautification projects, for which we have tied up with a major school of Arts, who will be using their world renowned expertise in designing various murals, motifs and different sculptures.</p>
