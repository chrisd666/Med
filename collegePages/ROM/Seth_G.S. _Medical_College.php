          <h3>About</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Founded in 1926, the Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College
            (GSMC) and the King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital are amongst the
            foremost teaching and medical care providing institutions in India.
            The medical college (school) provides training to about 2000
            students in undergraduate, postgraduate and superspeciality medical
            courses; in undergraduate and postgraduate physical and
            occupational therapy; Masters and PhD courses in various allied
            specialties. A nursing school is also maintained by these
            institutions.</p>
          <p>Institutional priorities have been medical relief, medical
            education and research. The glory of an institution rests on is
            traditions. Good traditions are difficult to establish and harder
            still to sustain. In spite of having much zeal for the new, there
            has not been contempt for what is old and therefore, it has been
            possible for us to offer a balanced blend of preventive, promotive,
            curative and rehabilitative services to the society. The stress has
            been on software rather than the hardware, health rather than
            disease, ethics and equality rather than concern only for a few
            elite and decentralisation and dissemination of services to the
            unreached rather than centralisation of sophistication within the
            walls of hospital.</p>
          <p>Unremitting zeal, devotion and professional competence of the
            medical and paramedical personnel have ensured that on completion
            of study, our young doctors do not want to play God, but they act
            as a tool in the hands of God to serve humanity.</p>
