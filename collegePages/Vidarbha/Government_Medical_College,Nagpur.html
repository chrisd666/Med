                        maintain the pace with modern advances
                        in medical field due to various reasons.

                        In addition to under graduation, the post graduation is
                        available in almost
                        all the disciplines. The students of this college are
                        serving all over the world
                        today. There are innumerable health administrators,
                        medical scientists, clinicians
                        and general practitioners who have brought laurels to
                        themselves and to this institute.
                        The name of this college is respected in regard to
                        clinical teaching and clinical
                        training all over the world. The clinical material is
                        abundant at this medical college.

                        The practice of full time teaching was so much imbibed
                        into the minds and bodies
                        of the teachers that nobody thought of practice. The
                        teaching profession was considered
                        honorable. An evening pay clinics were started at
                        respective out doors with a view
                        that affluent in the society would be attended to. But
                        was discontinued later. The
                        full time system was so deep-rooted in this medical
                        college that like other centres,
                        Honorary system could never be established here. Many
                        of the senior celebrated professors
                        were hand-picked to establish the Post Graduate
                        institute, Chandigarh and AIIMS,
                        New Delhi. Medical Sciences is progressing
                        continuously. This medical college had
                        a glorious past and every student and teacher feels
                        proud of association with this
                        institute. We need to keep the same hope in the minds
                        of students in generations
                        to come. It has potential to develop as an independent
                        institute or deemed university
                        which will help it to retain its old glory and
                        reputation.
